    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This chicken taco recipe is an <strong>easy</strong> one for those who don't like to spend a lot of time in the kitchen after a day of work. Most of the work will take place in your crockpot during the day and will be ready once you get home. This is also great for leftovers. I usually make enough to last a couple days. Enjoy!</p>
